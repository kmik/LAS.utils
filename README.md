A collection of LiDAR processing tools specifically designed to be used with LiDAR data from natural environments. Tools written in Java, executed with bash scripts. Project in progress...

Currently implemented tools:

  * LAS conversion to LAS and .txt files.
  * Classification of ground echoes.
  * Normalization of LiDAR data wrt. ground surface.
  * Clipping LAS files using polygons (.shp or WKT)
  * DSM/DTM creation.
  * Noise removal.
  * Thinning (both using 2D space and 3D voxels).
  * Tiling.
  * Merging.
  * Delineation of tree crowns.
  * Strip alignment (prototype)
