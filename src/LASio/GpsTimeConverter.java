/**
 * Provides methods for converting GPS times to Java's internal
 * milliseconds standard based on epoch 1 January 1970. Java is based
 * on the UTC system which depends on the use of leap seconds
 * which are issued by international committees at irregular intervals.
 * The classic Java Date API does not, itself support leap seconds, but
 * assumes that the length of a day is uniformly 86400 seconds.
 * However, the GPS time is a strictly linear time (adjusted for
 * relativistic effects) that is not not affected by leap second rulings.
 * So, in applications where we wish to be able to determine what time
 * the Java would report at a particular GPS time, we need to apply an
 * adjustment for leap seconds.
 * <p>
 * The GPS to Java time transition is complicated somewhat by the effect that
 * the conversation may actually produce the same Java value for two different
 * GPS times. For example, there was a leap second at the transition
 * from 30 June to 1 July in 2015. Thus the GPS times 1119744016 and
 * 1119744017 both map to 2015-07-01 00:00:00 UTC.
